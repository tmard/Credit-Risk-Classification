    "**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** According to the balanced accuracy score of 95%, the model is performing well; however, this is likely due to an imbalanced dataset. When analyzing the dataset, the number of healthy loans (low-risk) highly outweigh the number of high-risk loans. This indicates that the model is better at predicting a loan status as healthy in comparison to a loan status as high-risk. As the dataset is imbalanced, we need to further look at the resampled dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing both the balanced and imbalanced classification reports, the model is able to predict healthy loans `0` 100% of the time, with 99% of those recalled correctly. The model is only able to predict high-risk loans `1` with a precision of 85%, and of those 85% correctly identified there is a recall rate of 91%. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, precision and recall values are extremely improtant because the cost of misclassification can be high. A high precision score is important to minimize false positives, which can lead to a loss of potential customers. On the other hand, a high recall score is important to minimize false negatives, which can lead to significant financial losses.\n"
