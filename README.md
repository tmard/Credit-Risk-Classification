## Background
Use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.



## Objective
  
  
Using knowledge of Python and supervised machine learning to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.



## Credit Risk Analysis Report


Please see the file `credit_risk_analysis_report.md` for full details regarding the description of the analysis for the machine learning models, bulleted lists describing balanced accuracy scores, prediction and recall of all machine learning models and a summary of the results of the machine learning models with a recommendation on which model to use. 



## Method


### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets


1. Read the `lending_data.csv` data from Resources folder into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Create labels set (y) from 'loan_status' column and create features (X) DataFrame from remaining columns.
3. Check balance of the labels variable (y) with value_counts function.
4. Split dataa into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data


1. Fit a logistic regression model using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`).
2. Save predictions on testing data labels using the testing feature data (`X_test`) and the fitted model. 
3. Evaluate the mode's performance by completing the following:
        a. Calculate accuracy score of the model.
        b. Generate a confusion matrix.
        c. Print the classification report.

**How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?** 



### Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data


1. Use the `RandomOverSampler` module from the imbalanced-learn library to resample the data. Confirm labels have an equal number of data points. 
2. Use the `LogisticRegression` classifier and resampled data to fit the model and make predictions.
3. Evaluate the model's perforamnce by completing the following:
        a. Calculate accuracy score of the model.
        b. Generate a confusion matrix.
        c. Print the classification report.

**How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?**
